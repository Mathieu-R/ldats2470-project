\section{Introduction}

The aim of this project is to analyse a range of biomedical voice measurements from 31 people where 23 of parkinson disease. There are around 6 voice measurements per patient so that in total we have a collection of 195 observations. Each one contains severall voice measures that are detailled below. The `status` column indicate is the patient has the parkinson disease or not.

\section{Research question}

Using support vector machine algorithms we want to discriminate the patients based on their health status.

Firstly, we will begin with a basic descriptive analysis of the different variables composing this dataset. Then we will first try to perform an Hard Margin SVM. If needed, in case of the presence of outliers or a non linear dataset, we could investigate respectively the Soft Margin SVM or the use of the kernel trick.
